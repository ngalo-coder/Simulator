# Backend Utility Scripts Analysis Report

## Analysis Summary

This report analyzes the backend utility scripts in the SimulatorBackend directory to determine which scripts are obsolete and safe to remove.

## Analysis Methodology

1. **Script Content Review**: Examined each utility script to understand its purpose
2. **Dependency Check**: Searched for references in package.json, documentation, and other code files
3. **Usage Pattern Analysis**: Determined if scripts were one-time migrations, debugging tools, or active utilities

## Scripts Analyzed

### 1. addPatientNames.js
- **Purpose**: One-time script to add patient names to cases without names
- **Status**: OBSOLETE - One-time migration script
- **Safe to Remove**: ✅ YES
- **Reason**: This was a data migration script that has served its purpose

### 2. checkInitialPrompts.js
- **Purpose**: Debugging script to check initial prompts in cases
- **Status**: OBSOLETE - Debugging/inspection tool
- **Safe to Remove**: ✅ YES
- **Reason**: Debugging script, not part of application functionality

### 3. checkPatientNames.js
- **Purpose**: Debugging script to verify patient names in cases
- **Status**: OBSOLETE - Debugging/inspection tool
- **Safe to Remove**: ✅ YES
- **Reason**: Debugging script, not part of application functionality

### 4. checkPediatric.js
- **Purpose**: One-time script to check pediatric case setup
- **Status**: OBSOLETE - One-time verification script
- **Safe to Remove**: ✅ YES
- **Reason**: One-time verification script that has served its purpose

### 5. checkPediatricStatus.js
- **Purpose**: Debugging script to check pediatric case status
- **Status**: OBSOLETE - Debugging/inspection tool
- **Safe to Remove**: ✅ YES
- **Reason**: Debugging script, not part of application functionality

### 6. reorganize-programs.js
- **Purpose**: One-time migration script to reorganize cases into Internal Medicine program
- **Status**: OBSOLETE - One-time migration script (appears corrupted/incomplete)
- **Safe to Remove**: ✅ YES
- **Reason**: One-time migration script that appears corrupted and has served its purpose

### 7. test.js
- **Purpose**: Basic API testing script for simulation endpoints
- **Status**: OBSOLETE - Ad-hoc testing script
- **Safe to Remove**: ✅ YES
- **Reason**: Ad-hoc testing script, not part of formal test suite

### 8. testSimulationAPI.js
- **Purpose**: Testing script for simulation service functionality
- **Status**: OBSOLETE - Ad-hoc testing script
- **Safe to Remove**: ✅ YES
- **Reason**: Ad-hoc testing script, not part of formal test suite

### 9. test-db-connection.js
- **Purpose**: Database connection testing utility
- **Status**: OBSOLETE - Debugging/testing tool
- **Safe to Remove**: ✅ YES
- **Reason**: Debugging tool, database connection is handled by the application

### 10. updateInitialPrompts.js
- **Purpose**: One-time script to update generic initial prompts with personalized ones
- **Status**: OBSOLETE - One-time migration script
- **Safe to Remove**: ✅ YES
- **Reason**: One-time migration script that has served its purpose

## Reference Check Results

- ✅ **Package.json**: No references found in npm scripts
- ✅ **Documentation**: No references found in .md files
- ✅ **Source Code**: No imports or references found in application code
- ✅ **Scripts Directory**: No references found in other scripts

## Recommendation

All 10 utility scripts are safe to remove because:

1. They are not referenced in package.json scripts
2. They are not imported or used by any application code
3. They are not mentioned in documentation as active tools
4. They serve purposes that are either:
   - One-time data migrations (completed)
   - Debugging/inspection tools (not needed for production)
   - Ad-hoc testing (superseded by proper testing)

## Scripts Safe for Removal

```
SimulatorBackend/addPatientNames.js
SimulatorBackend/checkInitialPrompts.js
SimulatorBackend/checkPatientNames.js
SimulatorBackend/checkPediatric.js
SimulatorBackend/checkPediatricStatus.js
SimulatorBackend/reorganize-programs.js
SimulatorBackend/test.js
SimulatorBackend/testSimulationAPI.js
SimulatorBackend/test-db-connection.js
SimulatorBackend/updateInitialPrompts.js
```

## Next Steps

These scripts can be safely removed in the next task without affecting application functionality.
