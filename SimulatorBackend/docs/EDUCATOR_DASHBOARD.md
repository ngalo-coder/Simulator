- **Quick Actions**: Shortcuts to common tasks like creating cases, viewing students, and accessing analytics

### 2. Student Management
- **Assigned Students**: View and manage students assigned to the educator
- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed progress analytics for individual students
- **Filtering and Search**: Filter by discipline, activity status, search by name/email
- **Class Organization**: Create and manage student groups/classes

### 3. Case Management
- **Case Creation**: Create new cases using discipline-specific templates
- **Case Library**: Manage existing cases with filtering and search capabilities
- **Review Workflow**: Submit cases for review and manage approval process
- **Collaboration**: Add collaborators to cases with role-based permissions
- **Version Control**: Track case versions and changes over time

### 4. Analytics and Reporting
- **Case Analytics**: Detailed performance data for individual cases

interface DashboardOverview {
  overview: {
    totalStudents: number;
    activeStudents: number;
    totalCases: number;
    publishedCases: number;
    averagePerformance: number;
    completionRate: number;
  };

}
```

## Authentication and Authorization

All educator endpoints require:
1. **Authentication**: Valid JWT token
2. **Authorization**: User must have 'educator' or 'admin' role
3. **Data Access**: Educators can only access their own students and cases (admins have full access)

## Usage Examples

### Getting Dashboard Overview
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/educator/dashboard', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
const dashboardData = await response.json();
```

### Creating a New Case
```javascript
const caseData = {
  case_metadata: {
    title: 'Acute Myocardial Infarction',
    specialty: 'medicine',
    difficulty: 'intermediate'
  },
  description: 'A 55-year-old male presents with chest pain...',
  patient_persona: {
    name: 'John Doe',
    age: 55,
    gender: 'male'
  },
  clinical_dossier: {
    chief_complaint: 'Chest pain',
    hidden_diagnosis: 'STEMI'
  }
};

const response = await fetch('/api/educator/cases', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(caseData)
});
```

### Getting Student Progress
```javascript
const response = await fetch(`/api/educator/students/${studentId}/progress`, {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
const progress = await response.json();
```

## Performance Considerations

### Caching
- Dashboard data is computed on-demand but can be cached for short periods
- Student progress calculations are optimized with database aggregations
- Case analytics use efficient MongoDB aggregation pipelines

### Pagination
- All list endpoints support pagination with configurable page sizes
- Default page size is 20 items, maximum is 100
- Includes pagination metadata (total, pages, hasNext, hasPrev)

### Database Optimization
- Indexes on frequently queried fields (createdBy, assignedEducators, status)
- Aggregation pipelines for complex analytics calculations
- Efficient queries to minimize database load

## Error Handling

### Common Error Responses
```javascript
// Authentication Error
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Authentication required",
  "code": 401
}

// Authorization Error
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Access denied",
  "code": 403
}

// Validation Error
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Invalid case data",
  "errors": ["Title is required", "Specialty must be valid"],
  "code": 400
}

// Not Found Error
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Case not found",
  "code": 404
}
```
