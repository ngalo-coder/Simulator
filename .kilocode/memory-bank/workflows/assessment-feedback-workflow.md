- **Service**: [`InteractionTrackingService.js`](../../../SimulatorBackend/src/services/InteractionTrackingService.js)

### 2. Performance Data Analysis
- Aggregate interaction data into performance metrics
- Calculate scores against predefined criteria
- Identify patterns and trends in decision-making
- **Service**: [`AssessmentAnalyticsService.js`](../../../SimulatorBackend/src/services/AssessmentAnalyticsService.js)

### 3. Competency Evaluation
- Map performance data to learning objectives
- Assess clinical reasoning and critical thinking
- Evaluate technical skills and knowledge application
- **Service**: [`CompetencyAssessmentService.js`](../../../SimulatorBackend/src/services/CompetencyAssessmentService.js)

### 4. Intelligent Feedback Generation
- Create contextual, personalized feedback messages
- Provide evidence-based rationale for decisions
- Highlight learning opportunities and gaps
- **Services**:
  - [`FeedbackService.js`](../../../SimulatorBackend/src/services/FeedbackService.js)
  - [`AdvancedFeedbackService.js`](../../../SimulatorBackend/src/services/AdvancedFeedbackService.js)

### 5. Recommendation Engine
- Generate personalized learning recommendations
- Suggest remedial actions and practice opportunities
- Recommend next cases based on performance
- **Services**:
  - [`IntelligentRecommendationService.js`](../../../SimulatorBackend/src/services/IntelligentRecommendationService.js)
  - [`LearningPathService.js`](../../../SimulatorBackend/src/services/LearningPathService.js)
