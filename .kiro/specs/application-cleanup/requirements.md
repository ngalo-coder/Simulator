# Application Cleanup Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for identifying and removing obsolete files from the Virtual Patient Simulation application. The application has accumulated various utility scripts, documentation files, and components that are no longer needed or have been superseded by newer implementations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Backend Utility Script Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove obsolete backend utility scripts so that the codebase remains clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing backend utility scripts THEN the system SHALL identify scripts that were used for one-time data migrations or debugging
2. WHEN a script has served its purpose and is no longer needed THEN the system SHALL mark it for removal
3. WHEN removing utility scripts THEN the system SHALL preserve any scripts that are still actively used in development or production workflows

### Requirement 2: Documentation File Consolidation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to consolidate and remove redundant documentation files so that the documentation is current and not confusing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing documentation files THEN the system SHALL identify duplicate or superseded documentation
2. WHEN multiple files cover the same topic THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into a single authoritative source
3. WHEN documentation is outdated or no longer relevant THEN the system SHALL remove it
4. WHEN removing documentation THEN the system SHALL ensure that important information is preserved in the main README files

### Requirement 3: Test and Development File Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove obsolete test files and development artifacts so that the repository is clean and focused.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing test files THEN the system SHALL identify tests that are no longer relevant or have been superseded
2. WHEN development artifacts exist that are no longer used THEN the system SHALL remove them
3. WHEN removing test files THEN the system SHALL ensure that current test coverage is not affected

### Requirement 4: Component and Asset Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unused components and assets so that the application bundle size is optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing frontend components THEN the system SHALL identify components that are no longer referenced
2. WHEN assets or files exist that are not used in the current application THEN the system SHALL remove them
3. WHEN removing components THEN the system SHALL verify that no active code depends on them

### Requirement 5: Configuration File Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove obsolete configuration files so that the deployment and development setup is streamlined.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing configuration files THEN the system SHALL identify configs that are no longer used
2. WHEN multiple configuration files exist for the same purpose THEN the system SHALL consolidate them
3. WHEN removing configuration files THEN the system SHALL ensure that active deployments are not affected
