# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Analyze and identify obsolete backend utility scripts

  - Review each utility script in SimulatorBackend/ to determine if it's still needed
  - Check for any references to these scripts in package.json, documentation, or other files
  - Create list of scripts that are safe to remove
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 2. Remove obsolete backend utility scripts

  - Delete identified obsolete utility scripts from SimulatorBackend/
  - Remove scripts: addPatientNames.js, checkInitialPrompts.js, checkPatientNames.js, checkPediatric.js, checkPediatricStatus.js, reorganize-programs.js, test.js, testSimulationAPI.js, test-db-connection.js, updateInitialPrompts.js
  - Verify no active code references these scripts
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 3. Analyze and consolidate documentation files

  - Review all .md files to identify duplicates and outdated content
  - Compare API_Documentation.md with Backend_API_Reference.md to determine which to keep
  - Identify implementation notes that are no longer needed
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 4. Remove redundant and obsolete documentation files

  - Delete API_Documentation.md (superseded by Backend_API_Reference.md)
  - Remove implementation completion documentation files
  - Delete empty or obsolete documentation files
  - Remove files: dashboard-content-suggestions.md, switch-frontend.md, SimulatorBackend/AGENTS.md, SimulatorBackend/DESCRIPTION_UPDATE.md, SimulatorBackend/INTEGRATION-COMPLETE.md, SimulatorBackend/frontend-instructions.md
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 5. Remove frontend implementation documentation files

  - Delete implementation notes that are no longer needed for development
  - Remove files: simulatorfrontend/ERROR_HANDLING_IMPLEMENTATION.md, simulatorfrontend/LOADING_STATES_DEMO.md, simulatorfrontend/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATIONS.md, simulatorfrontend/SPECIALTY_FILTERING_IMPLEMENTATION.md, simulatorfrontend/SPECIALTY_ROUTING_TESTING_SUMMARY.md
  - Verify that important information is preserved in main README files
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 6. Remove obsolete frontend components and assets

  - Delete enhanced-dashboard-component.tsx from root directory (likely superseded by actual implementation)
  - Verify that this component is not referenced anywhere in the codebase
  - Check if functionality has been implemented elsewhere
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 7. Remove obsolete configuration and data files

  - Delete test/sample data files that are no longer needed

  - Remove files: SimulatorBackend/program1.json, SimulatorBackend/program2.json
  - Verify these files are not used in any configuration or seeding processes
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [ ] 8. Verify application functionality after cleanup

  - Run backend tests to ensure no functionality is broken
  - Run frontend build process to verify no missing dependencies
  - Test key application features to ensure cleanup didn't break anything
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 4.3, 5.3_

- [x] 9. Generate cleanup report and documentation

  - Create summary of all files removed and reasons for removal
  - Document any files that were kept despite being candidates for removal
  - Update main README files if necessary to reflect cleanup changes
  - _Requirements: 2.4_
