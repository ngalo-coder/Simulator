# Priority Features Implementation - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing the six priority functionalities to transform Simuatech into a comprehensive healthcare education platform supporting multiple healthcare cadres with robust user management, case administration, progress tracking, and scoring systems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Advanced User Management System

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a comprehensive role-based user management system so that I can manage students, educators, and admins with appropriate permissions and capabilities across multiple healthcare disciplines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN they SHALL be assigned one of three primary roles: student, educator, or admin
2. WHEN a student accesses the system THEN they SHALL only see cases appropriate to their healthcare discipline and level
3. WHEN an educator accesses the system THEN they SHALL be able to create, edit, and manage cases for their specialty area
4. WHEN an admin accesses the system THEN they SHALL have full system access including user management and system configuration
5. WHEN users have multiple roles THEN the system SHALL support role inheritance and permission aggregation
6. WHEN managing healthcare disciplines THEN the system SHALL support students from medicine, nursing, laboratory, radiology, and pharmacy
7. WHEN user profiles are created THEN they SHALL include discipline-specific information and competency tracking

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Case Management System

**User Story:** As an admin and educator, I want an intuitive case creation and management system so that I can efficiently add, review, and maintain high-quality simulation cases across all healthcare disciplines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating cases THEN the system SHALL provide discipline-specific templates for medicine, nursing, laboratory, radiology, and pharmacy
2. WHEN submitting cases THEN they SHALL go through a structured review and approval workflow
3. WHEN cases are created THEN they SHALL include learning objectives, difficulty levels, and competency mappings
4. WHEN managing cases THEN admins SHALL be able to bulk import, export, and organize cases by discipline and specialty
5. WHEN cases are published THEN they SHALL be automatically categorized and made available to appropriate user groups
6. WHEN case quality is assessed THEN the system SHALL track usage analytics and student feedback for continuous improvement
7. WHEN cases need updates THEN version control SHALL maintain history and allow rollback capabilities

### Requirement 3: Multi-Disciplinary Healthcare Case Support

**User Story:** As a healthcare student from various disciplines, I want access to realistic simulation cases specific to my field so that I can practice relevant skills and scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN nursing students access cases THEN they SHALL see patient care scenarios, medication administration, and care planning simulations
2. WHEN laboratory students access cases THEN they SHALL see diagnostic testing scenarios, result interpretation, and quality control cases
3. WHEN radiology students access cases THEN they SHALL see imaging interpretation, technique selection, and reporting scenarios
4. WHEN pharmacy students access cases THEN they SHALL see medication therapy management, drug interactions, and counseling scenarios
5. WHEN cases are designed THEN they SHALL include discipline-specific assessment criteria and learning outcomes
6. WHEN interdisciplinary cases are created THEN they SHALL support collaborative learning between different healthcare disciplines
7. WHEN case content is validated THEN it SHALL be reviewed by discipline-specific subject matter experts

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive Progress Management System

**User Story:** As a student, I want detailed progress tracking and the ability to review and redo previous work so that I can monitor my learning journey and improve my performance over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN students complete cases THEN their progress SHALL be tracked with detailed performance metrics and competency mapping
2. WHEN students want to review performance THEN they SHALL access comprehensive dashboards showing historical data and trends
3. WHEN students want to redo cases THEN they SHALL be able to reattempt cases with tracking of improvement over multiple attempts
4. WHEN progress is tracked THEN the system SHALL maintain detailed logs of all interactions, decisions, and outcomes
5. WHEN learning paths are created THEN the system SHALL recommend next cases based on performance and learning objectives
6. WHEN competencies are assessed THEN progress SHALL be mapped to professional standards and certification requirements
7. WHEN educators review progress THEN they SHALL access detailed analytics on individual and cohort performance

### Requirement 5: Advanced Scoring and Assessment System

**User Story:** As an educator, I want a consistent, reliable, and comprehensive scoring system so that student assessments are fair, accurate, and provide meaningful feedback for improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cases are scored THEN the system SHALL use standardized rubrics with weighted criteria for each discipline
2. WHEN scores are calculated THEN they SHALL be consistent across similar cases and comparable between students
3. WHEN assessment criteria are defined THEN they SHALL align with professional competency standards for each healthcare discipline
4. WHEN scoring algorithms are used THEN they SHALL be transparent, auditable, and based on evidence-based assessment practices
5. WHEN feedback is provided THEN it SHALL be detailed, actionable, and linked to specific learning objectives
6. WHEN scores are aggregated THEN they SHALL provide meaningful insights into competency development over time
7. WHEN scoring reliability is measured THEN the system SHALL track inter-rater reliability and assessment validity

### Requirement 6: Comprehensive Student Guidance System

**User Story:** As a student, I want comprehensive guidance and information throughout my learning journey so that I understand expectations, can navigate the system effectively, and maximize my learning outcomes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN students first access the system THEN they SHALL receive comprehensive onboarding with discipline-specific orientation
2. WHEN students navigate cases THEN they SHALL have access to contextual help, hints, and learning resources
3. WHEN students need guidance THEN the system SHALL provide intelligent tutoring and adaptive feedback
4. WHEN students are stuck THEN they SHALL access help systems, FAQs, and support resources
5. WHEN students complete activities THEN they SHALL receive immediate feedback with explanations and learning recommendations
6. WHEN students plan their learning THEN they SHALL access personalized learning paths and goal-setting tools
7. WHEN students need additional resources THEN they SHALL access integrated reference materials, guidelines, and best practices
