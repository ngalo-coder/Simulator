# Frontend API Integration Tasks - SimuTech Project

## Overview
This document tracks the integration of all 283 backend routes into the simuatech-frontend application. The goal is 100% API coverage with step-by-step implementation, testing, and validation. Total routes: **283**. Current coverage: **0%** (to be updated).

**Project Structure:**
- Backend: SimulatorBackend/src/routes/ (30 route files)
- Frontend: simuatech-frontend/src/ (using apiService.ts for API calls)
- Testing: simulatorfrontend/src/test/integration/
- Documentation: Backend_API_Reference.md

**Integration Approach:**
1. Categorize routes by functional area
2. Implement in phases (core first, utilities last)
3. Test each route individually before phase completion
4. Use browser_action for E2E testing
5. Track coverage with automated tests
6. Document integrations in Backend_API_Reference.md

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- Routes Implemented: 0/283
- Phases Completed: 0/8
- Test Coverage: 0%
- Issues Found: 0
