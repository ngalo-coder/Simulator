# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Update routing configuration to handle direct case access

  - Add new route pattern for `/simulation/:caseId` in App.tsx
  - Ensure both case-only and case-with-session routes work correctly
  - Test route matching with different URL patterns
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.1, 4.3_

- [x] 2. Enhance SimulationChatPage component for automatic simulation startup

  - Modify useEffect logic to detect case-only URLs and start simulations automatically
  - Update URL parameter handling to distinguish between caseId-only and caseId+sessionId scenarios
  - Implement proper state management for different URL access patterns
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1_

- [x] 3. Implement comprehensive error handling for simulation startup

  - Add error state management for different failure scenarios (invalid case, network, auth)
  - Create user-friendly error messages with appropriate actions (retry, redirect)
  - Implement proper error logging for debugging purposes
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 4. Add loading states and user feedback during simulation startup

  - Enhance loading indicators to show simulation startup progress
  - Add proper loading states for case validation and session creation
  - Ensure smooth transitions between loading and active simulation states
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 5. Implement URL redirection and consistency features

  - Add automatic URL updates when simulation starts (redirect to session URL)
  - Preserve specialty context during navigation and redirects
  - Ensure bookmark compatibility with new URL structure
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.4_

- [-] 6. Create unit tests for routing and component logic

  - Write tests for new route matching behavior
  - Test SimulationChatPage component logic with different URL parameters
  - Test error handling scenarios and state transitions
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation_

- [x] 7. Add integration tests for end-to-end simulation startup





  - Test complete flow from direct case URL to active simulation
  - Test error scenarios and recovery mechanisms
  - Verify URL consistency and navigation behavior
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.4_
