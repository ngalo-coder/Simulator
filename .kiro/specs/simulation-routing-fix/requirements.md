# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical bug in the simulation functionality where users cannot properly start simulations when navigating directly to case URLs like `/simulation/VP-OPTH-001`. Currently, the routing system expects a specific format that includes session IDs, but users should be able to start new simulations by simply navigating to `/simulation/{caseId}`.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a medical student, I want to start a simulation by navigating to `/simulation/{caseId}` so that I can quickly access and begin practicing with specific cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to `/simulation/{caseId}` THEN the system SHALL automatically start a new simulation session for that case
2. WHEN the simulation starts successfully THEN the system SHALL redirect to `/simulation/{caseId}/session/{sessionId}` with the new session ID
3. WHEN the case ID is invalid or not found THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and redirect to the case browsing page
4. WHEN the user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a medical student, I want the simulation to load properly with the patient's initial prompt so that I can begin the clinical interaction immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new simulation session starts THEN the system SHALL display the patient's initial prompt if available
2. WHEN no initial prompt exists THEN the system SHALL display a default greeting from the patient
3. WHEN the simulation loads THEN the system SHALL show the patient name and case information in the header
4. WHEN the simulation is ready THEN the system SHALL enable the chat input for user interaction

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a medical student, I want proper error handling during simulation startup so that I understand what went wrong if the simulation fails to start.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the simulation fails to start due to network issues THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
2. WHEN the simulation fails to start due to authentication issues THEN the system SHALL redirect to login
3. WHEN the simulation fails to start due to invalid case ID THEN the system SHALL redirect to case browsing with an error message
4. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a medical student, I want the simulation URL structure to be consistent so that I can bookmark and share specific simulations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user bookmarks `/simulation/{caseId}` THEN they SHALL be able to return to that URL and start a new simulation
2. WHEN a user shares `/simulation/{caseId}/session/{sessionId}` THEN the recipient SHALL be able to view that specific session (if authorized)
3. WHEN the URL structure changes THEN existing bookmarks SHALL still work through proper redirects
4. WHEN accessing simulation URLs THEN the system SHALL maintain specialty context for navigation
