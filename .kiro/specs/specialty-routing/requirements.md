# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements specialty-specific routing and navigation for the medical simulation platform. Currently, the "Browse cases" → "Explore cases" → "View cases" flow takes users to a generic `/simulation` route showing all cases. The new system will route users to specialty-specific URLs (e.g., `/internal_medicine`, `/pediatrics`) and display only cases relevant to that specialty, providing a more focused and intuitive user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a medical student, I want to browse cases by specialty so that I can focus on learning specific medical disciplines without being overwhelmed by irrelevant cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate through "Browse cases" → "Explore cases" → "View cases" for a specialty THEN the system SHALL route me to a specialty-specific URL (e.g., `/internal_medicine`, `/pediatrics`)
2. WHEN I visit a specialty-specific route THEN the system SHALL display only cases belonging to that specialty
3. WHEN I am on a specialty page THEN the system SHALL show the specialty name in the page title and breadcrumbs
4. WHEN a specialty has no cases THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a medical educator, I want specialty URLs to be bookmarkable and shareable so that I can direct students to specific medical disciplines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I bookmark a specialty URL THEN the system SHALL load the correct specialty page when accessed later
2. WHEN I share a specialty URL THEN other users SHALL be able to access the same specialty-filtered view
3. WHEN I navigate directly to a specialty URL THEN the system SHALL load the page without requiring navigation through the browse flow
4. WHEN an invalid specialty is accessed THEN the system SHALL redirect to a 404 page or default case browsing page

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want consistent navigation between specialty pages so that I can easily move between different medical disciplines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am on a specialty page THEN the system SHALL provide navigation to return to the main case browsing page
2. WHEN I am on a specialty page THEN the system SHALL provide navigation to other available specialties
3. WHEN I use browser back/forward buttons THEN the system SHALL maintain proper navigation history
4. WHEN I refresh a specialty page THEN the system SHALL maintain the current specialty context

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the routing system to be maintainable and extensible so that new specialties can be easily added without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new specialties are added to the backend THEN the system SHALL automatically support routing for those specialties
2. WHEN specialty names contain special characters or spaces THEN the system SHALL properly encode/decode them for URLs
3. WHEN the API returns specialty data THEN the system SHALL dynamically generate valid route paths
4. WHEN specialty names change THEN the system SHALL handle URL mapping gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the specialty pages to maintain all existing functionality while being filtered by specialty.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am on a specialty page THEN the system SHALL support all existing case filtering options (search, tags, etc.)
2. WHEN I start a simulation from a specialty page THEN the system SHALL function identically to the current implementation
3. WHEN I am on a specialty page THEN the system SHALL display case counts and pagination specific to that specialty
4. WHEN I perform actions on a specialty page THEN the system SHALL maintain the specialty context throughout the user session
